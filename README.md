# posefighter — POSE FIGHT

> **Hackathon team & AI agents: read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) first**, then your workstream doc in [`docs/agents/`](./docs/agents/). Coordination checklist: [`docs/HACKATHON.md`](./docs/HACKATHON.md).

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Start, Convex, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Start** - SSR framework with TanStack Router
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Convex** - Reactive backend-as-a-service platform
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Convex Setup

This project uses Convex as a backend. You'll need to set up Convex before running the app:

```bash
bun run dev:setup
```

Follow the prompts to create a new Convex project and connect it to your application.

Copy environment variables from `packages/backend/.env.local` to `apps/*/.env`.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Your app will connect to the Convex cloud backend automatically.

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@posefighter/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `bun run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Vercel Services

- Target: web
- Config: `vercel.json`
- Link the project first: bun run deploy:setup
- Local Vercel dev: bun run dev:vercel
- Sync preview env: bun run env:preview
- Sync production env: bun run env:production
- Dry-run check (no upload): bun run deploy:check
- Preview deploy: bun run deploy
- Production deploy: bun run deploy:prod
  Vercel Services share project environment variables, but deploys do not upload local `.env` files automatically. Link the project with `vercel link`, then run the env sync command before your first deploy (otherwise the deployment starts with no env vars), or pass one-off envs with `vercel deploy -e KEY=value`.
  Pass Vercel CLI flags to the env sync command directly, for example: `bun run env:production --scope your-team`.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying to Vercel](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/vercel).
